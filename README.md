# Backlift

## Introduction 

Backlift wants to make building and deploying websites easier, faster and more creative. 

Backlift's server, templates and helper libraries support:

* **Asynchronous updates:** Build apps that respond immediately to user actions while data is sent the the server in the background. 
* **API discovery:** Backlift will let you persist data without specifying the API up front. If you follow standard RESTful conventions, backlift will accept whatever data you throw at it.
* **Familiar libraries:** Backlift currently works with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org). We plan to integrate other javascript MVC libraries in the future.

Backlift's goals are to facilitate:

* rapid user experience prototyping,
* learning to write front-end javascript code, and eventually,
* deploying production websites used by millions.

## Getting started with Dropbox

Dropbox is now the suggested way to work with Backlift. You can login with Dropbox from the landing page at [backlift.com](https://www.backlift.com). Alternatively, if you already have an account, you can login and click on the "create app" page. From here you can link your account to Dropbox.

Linking Dropbox will give Backlift access to the Apps/Backlift folder within your Dropbox account. No other Dropbox content will be accessible to Backlift. This means that you can safely link Backlift with Dropbox without worrying that private information in your Dropbox account will be shared.

For an alternative to Dropbox, see the section on the [command line utility](commandline.html).
